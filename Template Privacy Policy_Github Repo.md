# **Automatic Data Collection Technologies**

*\[Consider your company’s use of automatic data collection technologies \-  the behind-the-scenes tools that websites and apps use to understand user behavior and improve the company’s services. The suggested wording below is a guide only and should be adapted to your company’s circumstances\]*. 

We and our designated service providers utilize a variety of automatic data collection technologies to gather information about you, your devices, and your online behavior. This data encompasses details about your visits to our Website, Apps, and Tools — including the specific pages or features you access, the duration of your visits, and the actions you take — and is collected using technologies that include, but are not limited to, cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, and log files. These technologies operate both on our platforms and across third-party websites over time. For further information regarding the cookies we employ and for guidance on how to control and remove cookies, please refer to our Cookie Policy *\[Note: link to your company’s cookie policy here\]*.

We may also collect information about your device and internet connection, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, and device identifiers. Additionally, we may track your online activities, such as the websites you visit, the links you click, and the searches you perform.

The purposes of this data collection include:

* Providing and enhancing the functionality, performance, and user experience of our Website, Apps, and Tools.  
* Detecting, preventing, and mitigating fraudulent activity, safeguarding both our users and our business.  
* Delivering relevant and personalized content, including advertisements, recommendations, and other communications that are tailored to your interests and preferences.

To that end, we provide you with a range of options to manage your data collection settings. You can adjust certain settings in your browser or device, such as disabling cookies or blocking third-party tracking. However, please note that doing so may limit your ability to access certain features or functionalities of our Website, Apps, and Tools.

# **Behavioral Advertising**

We and our service providers may use your personal data to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you. To learn more about how targeted advertising works, visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) educational page at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work](http://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work).

# **Do Not Track**

Do Not Track (DNT) is a feature offered by some web browsers, including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari, that lets users indicate their preference not to have their online activity tracked. This preference can usually be set in the browser's preferences.

While some regulatory authorities and industry groups support developing a mechanism to standardize DNT across the internet, websites currently respond to DNT browser settings in different ways.  If a website responds to a DNT signal by deactivating certain cookies or tracking technologies, the site may no longer recognize the user, save passwords or usernames, or provide full functionality.

# **Third-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**

Third-party advertisers, ad networks, servers, content providers, and application providers may serve some content or applications, including advertisements on the Website, Apps, and Tools. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies to collect data about you when you use the Website, Apps, and Tools. This data may be associated with your personal data or they may collect data, including personal data, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this data to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.

If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.

*\[Ensure your company and service providers have implemented data security measures. The suggested wording below is a guide only\]*

We and our service providers have implemented measures intended to secure your personal data from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. However, the safety and security of your data also depends on you. Where we or our service providers have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Website, the Apps and the Tools, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We and our service providers ask you not to share your password with anyone and to change your password from time to time. We and our service providers also highly recommend that you use a password that is dissimilar to and cannot be easily found by unauthorized third parties who may have obtained your login credentials to other sites. Keep in mind that if you use the same password for all websites, if someone obtains your credentials for one site, they may be able to then use those credentials to log into any other site you use. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure. Although we and our service providers try to protect your personal data, we and our service providers cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted through or collected through the use of the Website, the Apps and the Tools. Any transmission of personal data is at your own risk.  

We and our service providers are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website, the Apps and the Tools.

# **CALIFORNIA ADDENDUM TO PRIVACY POLICY**

*\[Even if your company isn’t based in the U.S., adding a California privacy addendum to your policy is important if you collect data from California residents or meet certain criteria under California privacy laws (CCPA/CPRA). These laws apply to businesses worldwide and can lead to fines if you don’t follow the rules. Including the addendum shows you care about privacy, builds trust with customers, and helps ensure your company complies with global privacy standards. It’s a simple way to avoid legal risks and protect your reputation.\]*

**This section of the Policy applies solely to California residents.** 

We adopt this Section of the Policy in order to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“**CCPA**”) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“**CPRA**”).  

Please note that certain terms used in this California-specific section of the Policy, such as “personal data,” “Sale,” “Share” and “Sensitive personal data” have the meanings given to such terms in the CCPA/CPRA, and not the common meanings of these terms in conversational English. The CCPA does not apply to certain data, which may be subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or certain other state or federal privacy laws.    

## **California Residents** 

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83, known as the “*Shine The Light*” law, permits users of the Website, the Apps and the Tools who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal data (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding year, and the names and addresses of those third parties.  You may request this data no more than once a year, but such request will be handled free of charge to you.  To make such a request, please send an email to *\[Your company’s email address for enquiries related to data privacy\]*.

## **Do Not Track and Global Privacy Controls**

The Website, Apps, and Tools currently respond to global privacy control (GPC) signals. We will make reasonable efforts to ensure compatibility with future GPC opt-out requests as technology evolves. To opt out of tracking on the Website, Apps, and Tools, enable the "do not track" or GPC setting in your browser's privacy settings, usually under cookie settings. Not all browsers currently have GPC extensions. Check your browser company's website for availability. For example, Mozilla provides instructions for enabling their experimental GPC control here: [https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2021/10/28/implementing-global-privacy-control/](https://blog.mozilla.org/netpolicy/2021/10/28/implementing-global-privacy-control/).

## **Notice of Financial Incentives**

*\[If your company sells user data, it should be disclosed and this section should be amended accordingly \- we recommend you seek formal legal advice if you are selling user data or provide financial incentives to users to share their personal data with your company\]*

**Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We or will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
