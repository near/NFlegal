* Functional Cookies: These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization, such as remembering your language preferences or login details. Although these cookies improve your experience, they are not strictly necessary for the website's functioning, and your consent is required for their use.  
* Performance Cookies: Performance cookies collect anonymous data on how visitors use our website. This data helps us understand how our site is used, which pages are most visited, and how effective our marketing campaigns are. These cookies help us improve the overall performance of our website. Your consent is required for their use.

# **Managing Your Preferences And Providing Or Withdrawing Consent**

You possess complete control over cookie usage.

Upon your first visit to our website, a cookie banner *\[Ensure your website has such a banner popping up for users in locations where it’s required\]* will appear, giving you the option to accept or reject different categories of cookies. You can manage your preferences at any time by accessing the "Cookie Settings" link available on our site.

| Why do I need a cookie banner ?If your website attracts visitors from regions with strict cookie laws (e.g., EU, UK, California), you must comply with their regulations by implementing a cookie banner.  Even in jurisdictions where explicit consent may not be legally required, a cookie banner helps inform users about data collection and provides options to manage their preferences, fostering trust and compliance with best practices. A cookie banner ensures compliance by allowing users to give specific, freely given, and informed consent through clear affirmative actions (e.g., clicking "Accept"). It also facilitates easy withdrawal of consent as required by GDPR and similar laws. |
