| A Non-Disclosure Agreement is a crucial legal document designed for situations where two parties (businesses or individuals), are considering a potential business relationship and are willing to share and/or receive sensitive information which parties need to keep confidential. It promotes trust and acts as an additional incentive to maintain the security and confidentiality of any applicable information, documenting each parties rights and obligations regarding the information to be shared.  Assumptions:  The below Non-Disclosure Agreement Template is what we call a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (MNDA), where both parties will share information, and both parties will be obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the agreements The purpose of the MNDA is not to be used in an investment or other acquisition/merger deal, where highly sensitive information regarding the financial or proprietary intellectual property information would be shared. This template is intended solely for the purpose of evaluating a potential business relationship    |

[^1]:  If a party is an individual, as opposed to a business (with a separate legal identity), consider the following format \[INSERT FULL LEGAL NAME\], residing at \[INSERT RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS\] 

[^2]:  Consider refining the purpose of the information disclosure, to better align with your specific goals.

[^3]:  When drafting and reviewing MNDAs, pay attention to how confidential information is defined. Would this cover any confidential information by nature (as opposed to information explicitly marked as confidential)? If confidential information was shared before an MNDA was signed, is this information covered? 

[^4]:  This template MNDA includes the standard exclusions, pay attention to any exclusions beyond those listed, as such information would not be protected under the MNDA. 

[^5]:  Pay attention to the term of the MNDA, and to the term of the confidentiality provision. It is not uncommon to find MNDAs including a disclaimer that the confidentiality obligation survives the term of the Agreement. The term of the Agreement is the period where confidential information may be shared between parties, whereas the term of the confidentiality provisions is the period for which the shared confidential information must remain confidential (and can be longer than the term of the agreement) 

[^6]:  Consider the specifics of your purpose and nature of the confidential information. How would you like your confidential information to be handled at the end of the MNDA? What are your obligations regarding the other party’s confidential information, is it achievable for you? 

[^7]:  Injunctive Relief allows a party to obtain a court order to prevent or stop a breach of confidentiality. It is often favored in the context of MNDAs because it addresses the potential for irreparable harm that monetary damages cannot adequately compensate for.

[^8]:  Consider the governing law and jurisdiction of the MNDA carefully. This will determine which law applies to the MNDA, and which courts will be competent to hear the case.
